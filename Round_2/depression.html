            <h2>The Limitations of Music Therapy for Depressed Person.</h2>
            <h4>Anxiety</h4>
            <p>While in some cases music may help ease anxiety disorders, in others it may cause or increase anxiety. The wrong music can cause distress and heightened anxiety in Alzheimer’s patients.The lyrics can have a huge impact on the mental state of the client the therapist is treating. Certain lyrics can represent a negative mindset and can overall increase a person’s sadness overtime. This is especially daunting in patients suffering from Depression.</p>
            <h4>Overstimulation</h4>
            <p>There are a lot of factors in regards to the sound behind music. These factors include the volume, acoustics, type of instruments used, and many others. Sound and music connect profoundly with stimulation. Stimulation referring to the physiological state of a person a.k.a. heartbeat, movement, blood flow, respiratory rate, etc. When someone is overstimulated by music, this may mean that the volume is too loud or the bass thump that can be felt in your chest is too overwhelming. This type of overstimulation is especially harmful for babies in the NICU. This can cause feelings of discomfort, agitation, and neurological stress. </p>
