            <h1>What is Alzheimer's Disease?</h1>
            <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease — those with the late-onset type symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.</p>

                <h1>How does Music Therapy help Alzheimer’s Disease?</h1>
                <p>Music evokes emotions and memories, which is why musical intervention has therapeutic benefits for people with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Musical interventions have been shown to decrease a patient’s agitation and improve communication and caregiver relationships.</p>
                <p>Perhaps one of the biggest benefits of music therapy is the increased healthy movement. Music can be the gateway to purposeful movement, whether that is clapping, swaying, or dancing. In the proper therapeutic setting, this movement can help the person increase strength, balance, and endurance, which can lead to decreased fall risk and increased motor function.</p>

            <h2>What kind of music is best for Alzheimer's Disease?</h2>
            <p>Listening to soft classical music or non-rhythmic instrumental background music may also improve mood and boost cognition, according to research. Studies show that stimulating the brain using classical music can enhance thinking — also known as “the Mozart effect.”</p>
            <h3>Songs that may help with Alzheimer's disease include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNHFU5ZjfLU">"Oh My Darling, Clementine"  by Freddy Quinn</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM">“He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands” by Sing Hosanna</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96Ug">“You Are My Sunshine”</a></li>

            <h2>The Limitations of Music Therapy for Alzheimer's disease</h2>
            <h4>It's comforting to believe that songs can help dementia patients recall their lost selves. But music can also harm as much as it helps, creating false memories, confusion, and distress.</h4>
            <p>Hearing problem: Listening to loud music can make you develop hearing problems. Continuous use of earphones and headphones can also worsen the condition since it will be difficult to regulate the volume.</p>
