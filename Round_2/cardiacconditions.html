            <h1>What is Cardiovascular disease?</h1>
            <p>A type of disease that affects the heart or blood vessels. The risk of certain cardiovascular diseases may be increased by smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and obesity. The most common cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease (narrow or blocked coronary arteries), which can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, or stroke. Other cardiovascular diseases include congestive heart failure, heart rhythm problems, congenital heart disease (heart disease at birth), and endocarditis (inflamed inner layer of the heart). Also called heart disease.</p>

            <h1>How does Music Therapy helps in Cardiovascular disease?</h1>
            <p>Research into music therapy as a complementary treatment alongside traditional medical treatment for physical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and heart failure, is promising. Listening to music for relaxation shows great potential for lowering one’s stress, heart rate, and blood pressure, and singing continues to appear as a way to strengthen the heart.</p>
            <p>Remember, music alone is not a treatment for heart disease.</p>
            <p>Listening to music provided some relief for coronary heart disease patients suffering from anxiety, by reducing heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
            <p>Music can make you laugh or cry, rile you up or calm you down. Some say it's good for the soul. It just might be good for the heart, too. Make no mistake — daily doses of Mozart won't clean out your arteries or fix a faulty heart valve. But music can help ease your recovery from a cardiac procedure, get you back to normal after a heart attack or stroke, relieve stress, and maybe even lower your blood pressure a tad.</p>

            <h2>What kind of music is best for Cardio Vascular Disease?</h2>
            <p>Patients with high blood pressure listened to classical music, Celtic music, or Indian ragas for a half hour every day for a month, leading to significant drops in systolic blood pressure, which is the top number when your blood pressure is taken. High systolic blood pressure increases heart disease risk.</p>
            <h3>Songs that may help with Cardio Vascular Disease</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssBUgHLdrCA">“Put a Little Love in Your Heart,” by Jackie DeShannon </a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM">“Listen to Your Heart,” by Roxettet</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96Ug"> “You’ll Be in My Heart,” by Phil Collins</a></li>

            <h2>The Limitations of Music Therapy for Cardio Vascular Disease.</h2>
            <h4>The Effects Of Rock Music On Heart Health</h4>
            <p>The study found that rock music can have a negative effect on heart health. The study found that rock music can increase heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to a number of health problems, including heart disease. </p>
            <p>Another study, conducted by researchers at the University of Texas, found that rock music can actually have a positive effect on heart health. The study found that rock music can help to reduce stress and anxiety, which can lead to a healthier heart. </p>
            <h4>So, does rock music affect heart health? </h4>
            <p>The answer is that it depends on the person. Some people may find that rock music has a negative effect on their heart health, while others may find that rock music has a positive effect on their heart health.</p>
