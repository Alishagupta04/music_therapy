                <h1>How does Music Therapy help Autistic people?</h1>
                <p>The literature reports that most individuals with ASD
                    respond positively to music. People with ASD often
                    show a heightened interest and response to music,
                    making it an excellent therapeutic tool for working
                    with them</p>
                <p>Music therapy helps individuals with ASD
                    identify and appropriately express their
                    emotions.
                    Because music is processed in both
                    hemispheres of the brain, it can stimulate
                    cognitive functioning and may be used for
                    remediation of some speech/language
                    skills.</p>
                <p>Research has shown that music therapy can help children develop or improve skills like shared attention, communication and play. It might help autistic children and children with intellectual disabilities more than typically developing children.</p>

            <h2>What kind of music is best for autism?</h2>
            <p>Music therapy for autistic people is often improvisational. This means the music is spontaneous and matches the temperament of the person playing.</p>
            <p>Music therapists say music with a strong beat, simple structure, and easy lyrics do best.</p>
            <h3>According to Autism Connect, songs that may help with autism include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssBUgHLdrCA">"Here Comes the sun" by the beatles </a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM">"Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96Ug">("Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay") by Otis Redding</a></li>

            <h2>The Limitations of Music Therapy for Autism</h2>
            <h4>Finding the Right Tune: Considerations for Choosing Music Therapy for Autism</h4>
            <p>When considering music therapy for individuals with autism, it is important to find a therapist who has experience working with this population. Additionally, it is important to consider the individual’s preferences and needs when selecting music activities. Some individuals may respond better to certain types of music or instruments, and it is important to tailor the therapy to their individual needs. Finally, it is important to be patient and persistent with music therapy, as progress may not be immediate and may require ongoing support.</p>
